 ### Website
 
 The website was designed to be as lightweight as possible and because of this JavaScript is not necessary for it to work. The underlying technology used is Jekyll and there is no framework used. CSS is built from SCSS files and everything is contained to remove the need for 3rd party assets and unnecessary connections.
